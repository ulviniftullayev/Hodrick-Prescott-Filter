Real Business Cycles theory is one of the core topics in modern macroeconomics. It is a study of short to medium term
fluctuations in the economy. Popularised in 1990s, the Hodrick-Prescott filter is a mathematical technique for time-series 
decomposition. It separates short-term fluctuations from long-term trend by smoothing out the data. The most useful tool
for the decomposition is the parameter lambda which sets the agression level of smoothing. The higher the lambda, the more 
the HP trend deviates from actual series. Economists debate over the correct calibration of lambda, but generally accepted 
value is 1600 for quarterly data.
